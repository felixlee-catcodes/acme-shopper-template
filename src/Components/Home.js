      <h1>Welcome to the CHRD Trainer home page!</h1>
      <p>
        CHRD Trainer is a web application designed to help users improve their
        ability to recognize individual chords and chord progressions through
        fun and interactive lessons.
      </p>
      <p>
        While there is some music theory involved, this application is primarily
        focused on ear training, so no knowlege of music notation is required to
        get started on this journey!
      </p>
      <p>
        This "no notation" approach is meant to mimic how we naturally learn our
        native languages as infants and toddlers. The average kid is
        comprehending speech and creating sentences well before learning to
        read. I believe that that capacity extends to music which is a complex
        language unto itself. And while the ability to read musical notation is
        a great skill to have, people have been learning and playing music long
        before written notation was standardized. In fact, a number of musical
        traditions are still passed down via solely aural methods.

      <h3>How the site and units are structured</h3>
      <p>
        In the "Chords" section you will learn about the basic building blocks
        of all chords, triads. You'll about the different tonal properties of
        major, minor, and seventh chords (to name a few). The goal is to be able
        to recognize these distinct tonal qualities by ear.
      </p>
      <p>
        Advanced chord training will introduce you to inversions as well as more
        complex chord tones via extended, suspended, and altered chords.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the "Progressions" section you'll be introduced to some of the most
        common chord progressions across a variety of musical genres and through
        rigorous training exercises you'll be able to recognize these patterns.
        For the purpose of better understanding progressions, I'll teach you
        about the roman numeral system commonly used to denote the natural order
        in which chords are built upon their corresponding scale degrees. Don't
        worry if this sounds confusing at this point, I promise it'll make sense
        once we're ready to really dive into it!
      </p>
      <p>
        Musicians of all levels can benefit from ear training exercises. Even
        producers and avid music fans will have something to gain from CHRD
        Trainer.
      </p>
      <p>
        And with that, let's get started! Perk up your ears and dive right in!
